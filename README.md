# Cloud Fitness Advice Bot

This app calculates a userâ€™s BMI from their height and weight, then recommend a set based on what they were looking for. This app was developed with the idea in mind of expanding access to fitness advice, allowing a user to be recommended exercise sets that could be available at any time and place.

The app is programmed in Python primarily, but the front-end web app uses Flask.
